Akshata Moharir, Aditya Deshpande, and I have developed an image classifier using the transfer learning algorithm to predict types of garbage.
The data for this analysis is store in the sample-20210506T225408Z-001.zip. This file has images from the six different garbage classes for prediction.
The ipython file can be called in Jupyter or Google Colab and the .html file can be imported to databricks to replicate the process and results of our analysis.
